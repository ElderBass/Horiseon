# Purpose of Repository
This repository is the first of many homework assginments submitted by Seth Zygarlicke, who solely wrote/edited the code within. The task was to edit an html file (named "index_original.html") and its corresponding css file, into a more streamlined, accessible, and logical set of code. 

# Files Included in Repository:
The first assets folder, outside of all other folders, contains the original style.css file within the "css" folder. It also includes the folder "images" that contains all of the pictures used in the index_original.html file. 

The second folder listed, Develop, contains the meat of this exercise. It, too, has an assets folder with a css child folder harboring the EDITED style.css file. Also inside of the assets is again the set of images used in the .html file, found in the images folder. 

Develop itself houses the index_changed.html file, which is the edited version of the index_original.html. It also holds a .txt file named "Changes-I-Made" which details all of the edits and consolidations Seth made during this assignment. I trust it is sufficiently grammatical. 

The index_original.html file is found outside all of the other folders.
