I am going to list the changes in no particular order,
just in the order that I thought to change them and write them down.

Cheers.

1.) Changed the title of the website from "website" to "Horiseon".

2.) Made fairly descriptive "alt" tags for each of the images.

3.) Replaced the <div class="header"> and <div class="footer> elements 
    to the proper semantic tags <header> and <footer> respectively.
    --Accordingly, erased all . from ".header" and ".footer" in CSS
    

4.) Consolidated A LOT of lines of code in CSS

    --Firstly, I noted that the ".benefit-lead h3", ".benefit-brand h3", and
      ".benefit-cost h3" classes ALL had the same style modifiers, so
      I put them all in the same set of brackets.
      

    --Secondly, and likewise, the ".search-engine-optimization", ".online-reputation-management", 
      and ".social-media-marketing" classes all had the same styling as well,
      thus I also placed them under the same brackets.
        ---Ditto for these tags' respective images' max heights and h2 styles.
        --I also cut this content out from its original position in CSS and placed it directly below/After
          ".content", since this is how it sequentially appears in HTML as well. More sensical for it to be there.

        
5.) I eventually noticed that the class tags for the search-engine-optimization, 
    online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing ON TOP OF the id tags, 
    but since the id tags were needed for the links in the header to work properly, 
    I went ahead and deleted the redundant class tags.

6.) Deleted the CSS "header div ul {list-style-type: none}" since that's what the list
    would do by default, so it didn't really need to be there.

7.) Deleted the "header h1" from "header h1 .seo" in CSS since all that needed to be called
    for the styling to work was just ".seo".

8.) Sort of a nitpicky, personal preference thing, but to .benefit I added a "text-align: center;" style since the 
    images in that block of content were also centered, and the text looked bad in a left-alignment. Yuck.

9.) I'm not entirely sure how this happened, but I was CERTAIN that the "Search Engine Optimization" link in the header
    was not working the first time I checked it, then I messed around with some entirely (seemingly) unrelated code, and
    decided to check the links again and they all worked fine. It might have been due to me deleting the class tags 
    and just leaving the id tags for the respective links...? I haven't the faintest idea lol. 


    ????QUESTIONS AS I THINK OF THEM????
